I did not want to move my files out of week 6 because it was causing issues.
Here is the link to week 6 Git files.
https://github.com/JacobFerber/MART-120/tree/main/Homework-6

Once there just open the Homepage. I left everything from last week so the file is pretty messy. 
Next week I want to learn how to have better organization with my pages.
