            <head> Short Story <head>

                  <head> One day Charlie went to the store to buy ice cream. He bought Choccy chhunks because that is his favorite flavor. He rode his eletric longboard along the cracked sidewalk peering out at Lake Washington when he could. 
                   Between checking for cracks and potholes he sneaks a glance. Suddenly he feels his front wheels pitch forward violently, the trucks grip gravel - Usually they glide over the smooth pavement - He lets the weight of his
                   torso pitch with the wheels and instinctively tucks his legs. Directing his spin with his outstretched arms, Charlie spots his landing and extends his legs. The soles of his shoe slam into the ground and he manages to
                   run away from an accident. <head>
